Release 5: Reflect

What was this experience like?
This so far has been my favorite challenge. I enjoy coding and was lucky to be the person assigned
to translate pseudocode into actual code. The members of my group did a great job of communicating and 
promptly finishing their portion of the challenge and passing it on. Austin was even kind enough to research 
functions he referenced and provide supplemental links. I had adequate time to analzye the pseudocode and learn new 
JavaScript functions and concepts. 


Was your group successful in passing the tests?
Passed with flying colors.

What did you learn about writing user stories, pseudocoding, writing code, refactoring, etc.?
It's good practice to get a solid idea of what you're looking to accomplish in non-technical plain english. Once 
you have your idea and goals down the next step obvious is to translate your idea's into JavaScript concepts. Pseudocode
gives you a solid guide to accomplishing your goals.
