Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I initially stepped back from my screen and took a long hard look at each sites layout. Noticing it's logo, how and where it's displayed, making note of their attributes. I asked myself to describe how each site displayed it's content. Stated what I like feel the sites accomplish and where they fail as far as design goes. This excercise help me put into perspective what exactly I get from each of these sites. I go to google for the endless knowledge, serious eats for the food porn, and deadspin for it's comedic value.
