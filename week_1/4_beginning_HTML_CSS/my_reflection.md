## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

HTML structure and syntax makes everything clear and simple to learn. Video, links, and images are easily embedded onto a page. The line between HTML and CSS is still kind of a blur to me. I initially struggled with when to apply CSS because I have very little experience with it. Glad to learn making changes to multiple elements like "headers" were made simple by CSS

These are some of the resources I used
