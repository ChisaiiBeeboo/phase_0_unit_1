Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

It's a relief to learn that everyone share the same doubts and reservations about themselves, it connects us on some level. It's great that everyone is open and honest about their limitations, but what's more important is that they're aware of it and are pushing themselves to face their fears. That's the definition of growth for me. The week thus far has been a bit hectic, moving out took up the majority of my week leaving me with the weekend to work on the challenges. I feel a slight panic setting in as I'm hustling to catch up on the material and submit my work. Better time management is in order!
