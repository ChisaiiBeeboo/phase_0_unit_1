w3 school was tremendous for this challenge, having no HTML/CSS experience prior to this I initially felt lost and frustrated. The GDI slideshow made the HTML portion of the exercise pretty simple. I'm struggling with CSS, I understand the logic behind absolute and relative positioning, but am lost as far as knowing what values/dimension to use. I understand HTML tags, it's the positioning of objects I'm still trying to grasp. A fellow boot pointed me towards a treehouse tutorial that should clear things up. I enjoyed the HTML portion of the challenge much more than the CSS portion, the numbers were extremely tedious.

**edit I scrapped my initial dbc2 project because I felt it was lacking. I swapped it out for a page I formatted while following the Treehouse front-end dev track. I managed to complete the majority of assigned task but couldn't quite figure out floating. This was by far the most frustrating challenge as the result of my inability to float objects without breaking up the rest of the page. Adding to the frustration I also forgot to back up my project before making changes to it and had to start over from scratch after devoting so many hours to the project. I'll be hitting up office hours and fellow boots to help clear up floats.The upside, I was able to recreate the page by memory.
