## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Had no trouble setting up git and Github, I worked with both briefly on my Windows machine. 

git is a project collaboration tool that's run in your computers terminal. A version control system that allows you to mirror the code you've written locally on your computer to a remote server (ie. Github).

Github is an online community for developers with Facebook/Dropbox functionalities, where in place of personal information on Facebook it's populated with ones code. It provides a central hub for the coding community to store and share their work.The code you write on your computer is uploaded (aka pushed) through git to Github where it's acessible online for other developers to sync with (aka pull). A lot like the remote-access you have to your Dropbox files. Changes to a file are tracked and updated to newer "versions" on Github. So at any given time everyone is working on the latest version of the file, while never losing the original file. This makes sense because version control is conducive to a better workflow when multiple developers are involved.
