## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Part A Create Github repository:
Step 1. Log onto your Github account
Step 2. Click on the green button on the right side of the page labled "New repository" (you can also use the drag down menu located at the top right corner of the page labeled "+")
Step 3. Name your repository and give it an optional description
Step 4. Decide whether you would like to make the repository 'Public' where it's accessible to all, or 'Private' where you can choose who can access the content.
Step 5. Check the box to "Initialize this repository..." (add licensing accordingly to your intent)
Step 6. Click the green box labeled "Create repository" to see your repository!

Part B Cloning repository to your computer:
Step 1: Open the Github app on your computer
Step 2: Select your username located on the left side of the window (this should display a list of your github repo's)
Step 3: Select the repository you created in Part A 
Step 4: Click the "Clone to Computer" button located directly to the right. And you're done!


Open source is a developmental practice that allows software to be produced and consumed freely. The source code is available to anyone who chooses to contribute to a piece of software that will be made free to the public.

I believe Open Source is what drives real meaningful progress. It aligns the right group of people with the right motivation to produce something that is created through pure kindness. As opposed to a product that's been designed by a team who's motivation is deadlines and profit. 

Licensing will determine whether your software can be modified/shared for free or used privately.

This is the first time I've come across the term "Copyleft" Wiki has a pretty thorough explanation of it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft


Challenge was pretty straight forward. I had worked with Git and Github prior to this through another online tutorial. Although I was working through the terminal last time around, this did help refresh my memory a bit. I have a better understanding of OS licensing through the "Open Source Licenses" slideshow.
