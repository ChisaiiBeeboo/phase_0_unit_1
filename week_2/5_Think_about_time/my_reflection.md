# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?
I have a tendency to get stuck on a problem and won't move on until it's been resolved. I end up not leaving myself enough time to work on the rest of the assignment.

* How will you combat that?
Pick the lowest hanging fruit first. Leave the more challenging work for the end. 


* What techniques will you try?
Timeboxing

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
Discipline! Know when to reach out for help.
