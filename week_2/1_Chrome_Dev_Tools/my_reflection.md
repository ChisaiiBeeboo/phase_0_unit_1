# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

DOM is an application programming interface that provides an interactive space for programmers to navigate and edit their HTML or XML documents. 


* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

Wordpress uses a ton of JS and, which is clearly lacking in mine. 

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

Navigating DOM and playing with it's tools is a bit daunting for a beginner like myself. The interface is not user-friendly at all; small text, tons of small windows and countless tabs/icon/menu's made it a pain to navigate. 

 Code Schools buggy challenges and vague instruction made it more frustrating than helpful.  

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Finally!! A tool I can use to edit a page and see the results in real-time. Beats refreshing and going back and forth between sublime and browser.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
