# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive design means having an adaptive layout that changes according to what device the user is viewing your site from. It's good practice as more and more users are moving away from browsing on traditional laptop/pc monitors and onto smartphone screens and browsers.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Mobile devices have changed web design in that developers are forced to consider performance, content, and functionality that works across all viewing platforms. Developers must take a modular approach to building systems rather than pages.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

The visually impaired use the web through screen readers, everyone should be considered when designing and developing.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

Take the mobile first approach.
