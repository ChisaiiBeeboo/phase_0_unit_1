Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

It's best to design your site for mobile devices first, then add more complex styling as you go to provide an optimal viewing experience. This ensures a graceful graduation of layout when viewing from smartphones, to tablets and monitors.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I enjoyed designing because of the immediate gratification, your code translates instantly to your browswer where you're able to see the fruits of your labor. I didn't care for wireframing, but my site is pretty basic in layout, not sure it was necessary. I'm sure it's helpful when designing a more complex website.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I modeled my site design after one of my favorite sites www.foodgawker.com, I was able to incorporate a lot of the skills I developed over the last 2 weeks. It's a pretty simple layout that I hope I can improve with Javascript. 

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

More visuals, I'm considering some sort of page preview in place of the current stock folder image I'm using currently. 


* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

Treehouse tutorial did a great job of explaining concepts and walking me through the entire process of designing my website. I'm very happy about having my own little space on the world wide web.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
