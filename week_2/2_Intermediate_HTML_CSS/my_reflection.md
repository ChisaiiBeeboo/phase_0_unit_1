# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

I think web standards does a great job of keeping everyone on the same page when building out a site. Collaborating on projects is easier for deveopers because when everyone is using the same structure, navigating and editing content becomes simple. 

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

Standard HTML structure is essentially a Head and a Body, doesn't get much more simple than that. You keep all your meta data(title, styles ) in the head, and your content in the body.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

As far as code readability HTML5 makes everything look cleaner, it's easier to spot '<header></header>'s than picking out a particular div among a page filled with div's
 
* Why is reset.css necessary? 

Each browser has their own set of parameters that they apply to your stylesheet. reset.css is necessary to reduce the inconsistencies between those parameters, ensuring your page looks the same across all browsers.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

Currently using Chrome, prior to this I was using Firefox. Visually I didn't notice the difference between the two. I prefer Chrome because it felt faster. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
